Over the past 6 years I have been working as a visual effects compositor adding effects to images and video. My work has comprised of films including Gravity, Harry Potter, Iron Man, and more for which I have been fortunate enough to be part of a BAFTA and Academy Award winning team. Additionally I have had experience working on commercials for advertising companies which include Nike, Addidas, Compare the Market and Unilever.  

More recently I have wanted to expand my horizons regarding learning and problem solving. Furthermore I have been looking for the opportunity to find a more structured career route which has led me to computer programming. Due to this, since February 2016, I have been learning to code and have currently just finished a 16 week course in web development at Makers Academy.

In total I have covered over 1500 hours of coding and at present I am looking for a developer role which provides opportunities to learn and grow in a fun and exciting environment.
